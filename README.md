# UltimateDonation

**UltimateDonation** is a plugin for [SCP: Secret Laboratory](https://store.steampowered.com/app/700330/SCP_Secret_Laboratory) built with the [EXILED](https://github.com/Exiled-Team/EXILED) framework. This plugin is designed to manage donor privileges in a way that **restricts access to administrative controls**, while allowing donors to use controlled commands and features configured by the server administrators. This ensures that donor abuse of admin commands is entirely avoided.

## üìö Additional Guides for Players

We have created detailed guides for donors that are already formatted for Discord and are perfect for showcasing the server‚Äôs donor privileges:

- **[English Guide for Donors](https://github.com/D3ltA-O5/Ultimate_Donation/blob/main/eng_guide_for_donaters)**  
- **[Russian Guide for Donors](https://github.com/D3ltA-O5/Ultimate_Donation/blob/main/ru_guide_for_donaters)**

## üéØ Purpose

The primary purpose of **UltimateDonation** is to provide donors with enhanced in-game privileges without compromising server security or administrative integrity. Donors **do not gain access to admin controls or the Remote Admin (RA) panel**. Instead, they are granted access to **carefully controlled commands** with strict limitations, ensuring fair and balanced gameplay.

Key safeguards include:
- **Controlled Commands**: Donors can only use commands explicitly allowed by their roles.
- **Global and Per-Role Limits**: All donor commands have usage limits per round, configurable in the plugin's settings.
- **Blacklist System**: Prevent donors from accessing restricted roles or items.
- **Freezing Mechanisms**: Temporarily suspend donor privileges globally or individually, with compensation for frozen time.

This plugin is ideal for servers that want to reward donors while maintaining strict administrative control.

## üéâ Features

- **Secure Role-Based Privileges**: Assign custom roles to donors with predefined permissions.
- **Controlled Commands for Donors**: Enable donors to use specific commands like `.changerole` or `.giveitem` without access to RA.
- **Global and Individual Freezing**: Freeze donor privileges to temporarily suspend their effects.
- **Usage Limits**: Track and enforce per-round limits on donor command usage.
- **Custom Prefixes**: Allow specific donor roles to set personalized prefixes with custom colors.
- **Blacklist System**: Restrict donors from accessing certain roles or items.
- **Aliases for Convenience**: Shortened command aliases for ease of use.
- **Fully Configurable**: Adjust every aspect of the plugin via configuration and translation files.

   Server administrators have full control over which commands donors can use and how often they can use them. The plugin enforces strict per-round limits to maintain balance.
