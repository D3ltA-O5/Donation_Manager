## 💎 **Your Commands**

After acquiring donor status, you will have access to special commands. Use them in the in-game console (`~`) or in chat where applicable.

### 🔄 **Change Role**
Allows you to change your role at the start or during the round (if permitted by your donor role).

- **Command**: `.changerole <RoleName>`  
  **Examples**:  
  - `.changerole 173` — Become SCP-173.  
  - `.changerole scientist` — Become a scientist.

- **Aliases (shortcuts)**: `.cr`, `.role`

### 🎁 **Get Items**
Allows you to receive items if permitted by your donor role.

- **Command**: `.giveitem <ItemName>`  
  **Examples**:  
  - `.giveitem rifle` — Get a rifle.  
  - `.giveitem medkit` — Get a medkit.

- **Aliases (shortcuts)**: `.gi`, `.givei`

### 📝 **Check Donation Status**
Check information about your donor status: how many days are left, what commands you can use, and how many times you’ve used them this round.

- **Command**: `.mydon`  
  **Example Output**:  

`=== Your Donation Status ===

Role: KETER
Days Left: 29
Permissions: changerole, giveitem

### 🎨 **Set a Custom Prefix**
Some donor roles allow you to set a custom prefix and color for your name in chat and the player list.

- **Command**: `.donator prefix <Prefix> <Color>`  
  **Example**: `.donator prefix [VIP] green`

---

## ⚙️ **How Donor Privileges Work**

- All commands and features are tied to your donor role.  
- You cannot exceed the command usage limits set for your role (e.g., 5 uses per round).  
- Certain roles or items may be restricted due to server settings.
